Wendys vs Mcdonalds: Surprisingly, the results of the process interaction simulation shows that the Multi-queue line tends to have
much more unstable and longer Queues than a single Queue system. With the Multi-queue, the Mean Wait time and Std Deviation both hover around
20, for both Queues. Meanwhile, the average wait time and the standard deviation sit around 10, which not only means the average wait is shorter,
but that wait times rarely exceed 20, which is the average wait time for the multiqueue.
